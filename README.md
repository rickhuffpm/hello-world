# hello-world

I'm going back to my roots! I am a Northeastern University alum and currently enrolled in their evening hybrid Intermediate Data Analytics program. In 1995, I graduated with honors and a dual major in Management Information Systems and Accounting. In 1997, I successfully completed the Certified Public Accounting (CPA) exam. In 2017, I successfully earned Project Management Professional (PMP) certification.

I am actively looking for part-time or full-time roles in data analytics and science in the Boston, Needham, and Westborough areas. My experience converting business requirements and strategy into organized, successful tactical activities is well anchored with strengths in researching, organizing, and filtering information. Past employers and clients include: Forrester Research, MathWorks, Sonos, CVS Health, Johnson & Johnson, DellEMC, Boston Scientific, and Cognex.  While on sabbatical (2017-2018), I have advanced my project management skills, enhanced my interpersonal communications, and began learning JavaScript and Python.
